* by Huang Du (Song Dynasty)

家君甫六十，尽弃人间事，筑室于孟塘山之阴而居之，终日徜徉于群山之中，既乃作亭北冈，回眺周览，万象偃伏，据登临之要。度尝侍侧，家君曰：“何以名斯亭？”度对曰：“请名‘爱山’。”家君曰：“试言其意。”

My family's patriarch just turned sixty. He has abandoned all worldly concerns and built a residence in the shade of Mengtang Mountain to dwell in. He spends his days wandering among the mountains, eventually constructing a pavilion on the northern hill. From this vantage point, one can look back and see all around; the world lies subdued at one's feet. It is a crucial spot for looking out over the landscape. Once, I was in attendance by his side. My family's patriarch asked, "What shall we name this pavilion?" I replied, "May I suggest calling it 'Love of Mountains'?" He said, "Please explain your reasoning."

度对曰：“市朝山林，出处之趣异也，纷华淡泊，躁止之机不同也，而各求其志，各乐其乐，盖有终其身不相为也。”

I replied, "The interest in going to and fro between the bustling city and the tranquil mountains is different. The motivations behind seeking the limelight or embracing simplicity, and between restlessness and serenity, vary from person to person. Everyone follows their own path and finds their own joy, never necessarily crossing paths."

“今夫往者如赴，还者如拒，委者如逊，突者如怒，方夭矫以龙骞，忽轩昂而鹤举，此山之布列曼衍，相为面势者也。朝暾升而凝紫，夕霭合而浮碧，暝欲雨而深黝，晃初霁而浓鲜，此山之变化翕忽，异姿而同妍者也。春秋耕获，旦暮薪刍，林空而弋，水落而渔，牲牲乎麋鹿之群友，交交乎禽鸟之鸣呼，此山间之人物错杂，耳目接之而为娱者也。”

"The mountains have their own language: their peaks rise and fall like dragons soaring and cranes lifting their heads. The scenery is ever-changing: the morning sun turns the sky purple, and the evening mist brings a floating green hue. It darkens as if about to rain, and brightens freshly after a storm. This is the whimsical transformation and the consistent beauty of the mountains. Humans interact with this environment too: they farm and hunt, fish when the water level is low, accompanied by the calls of birds and the presence of deer."

“故自夫出而动者观之，则诚虚空寂寞，何足爱者；自夫入而止者观之，则山与人常莫逆也，意消神融，则亦不知其然而然也，此爱山之意。”

"Thus, if you view it as a place to leave, it may seem empty and desolate. But if you see it as a place to dwell, both the mountains and their residents offer ceaseless harmony. As your mood calms and your spirit melds with the surroundings, you won't even realize how naturally you've come to love the mountains. This is the meaning behind 'Ai Shan' (Love of Mountains)."

家君辗然笑曰：“汝知其外而不知其内，知其为可爱而不知吾之所以为爱也。泰华嵩衡，名其高也；涂室阳荆，名其险也，若夫箕首商蒙，岘完庐桐，其高可阶，其险可通也。而其名闻于天下者，以其人也。思其人爱其木，而况于山乎。”

The family patriarch chuckled and said, "You understand the exterior but not the interior, you know why they are lovable but not why I love them. As for Mount Tai, Mount Hua, and Mount Song, they are famous for their height; Tu, Shi, Yang, and Jing are known for their steepness. But places like Ji Shou and Shang Meng, Xian Wan and Lu Tong, are neither particularly high nor steep, yet their names are known far and wide. It is because of their people. If one can love the flora because of the people living there, how much more so can one love the mountains themselves?"

汝试凭高而望之：直东危峰中立，俄然如侧弁者，岇山也，岂非道深法师之所居乎？方其师友万乘，奔走公卿而能等朱门衡茅为一致，卒归老于空山，故吾爱其洁。少南，平冈隐阜，交互经纬者，沃洲也，岂非支遁之所栖止乎？虽为浮屠氏之学，而有当世之望，一时名士，出处不同，尽从之游，片言只语，皆足垂世，故吾爱其达。

"Try standing at a high vantage point and looking around: directly to the east stands a precarious peak, suddenly appearing as if it leans to one side—that's Ying Mountain, isn't it the dwelling place of Dao Shen master? His friends are influential figures who hold important posts, yet he has always maintained his purity and ultimately chose to retire in these secluded mountains. Hence, I love its purity. To the southeast, hills interlock in a grid—that’s Wo Province, where isn't it the dwelling place of Zhi Dun? Despite being a Buddhist, he enjoyed great reputation in his time, and everyone, despite different social statuses, sought his wisdom. Thus, I love its openness."

北出坂陇支辏，有如倚剑塞其冲者，金庭也，岂非王逸少之所出入乎？识鉴精微，有经世实用，而不肯降志辱身，故吾爱其坚。又北出，秀嶂端整，如桓圭出于众山之表者，四明也，岂非谢安石之所游息乎？苍生喁喁，以其出处为安危，而高卧空谷，若将终身焉，故吾爱其远。界乎东南之间，层峤叠壁，如连云、如阵马者，天姥也，岂非李太白所尝登蹑者乎？当其文章名海内，人主一见倾属之，而飘然情兴，形乎梦寐，故吾爱其逸。

"To the north, beyond the slopes and bends, stands a mountain like a sword guarding its territory—that's Jin Ting, isn't it where Wang Yishao used to frequent? His insights were useful for his time, yet he never compromised his integrity, and thus I love its steadfastness. Further to the north, majestic peaks stand tall and upright, like a distinguished jade tablet amidst other mountains—that’s Si Ming, where Xie Anshi used to wander. He cared little for worldly affairs and preferred solitude, thus I love its remoteness. Between the southeast, layers of cliffs stack upon one another, like a line of clouds or a formation of horses—that’s Tianmu Mountain, isn’t it where Li Bai once climbed? Despite his talents being recognized by the emperor, he always followed his own whims, hence I love its free spirit."

“环吾之庐，左右一舍，而山之名闻者五。建霞标于苍巅，凛清风于千载，虽蕙帐其已空，想謦欬之犹在，小子其能知吾之心乎？”度对曰：“度不敏，诚不足以知此。”家君曰：“为吾志之。”度再拜曰：“唯唯。”退而书之，为《爱山亭记》。 

"Surrounding my humble abode, to the left and right there's just one house, but the names of five renowned mountains can be heard. The rosy clouds mark their towering peaks, and the clear winds have howled for a millennium. Even though the sage's tent may now be empty, one can still imagine the lingering echoes of his coughs and sighs. Do you, young one, understand my heart?" I replied, "I am not wise enough to fully grasp this." My family patriarch said, "Then make it your aspiration." I bowed deeply twice, saying, "I will, I will." I then withdrew and recorded this, thus composing 'Ode to the Love of Mountains Pavilion'.

旃蒙赤奋若冬，季男度谨书。

Respectfully written by Du, the youngest son, in the winter of the Yi Chou year
