> In yonder chair, thou sit'st, gazing through pane,<br/>
> Where light in fleeting dance does gently flow.<br/>
> With hands outstretched, on parchment, dreams thou stow,<br/>
> Thou speak'st of blooms that fall, in cyclic chain.<br/>

> "A window's tale," thou muse, "of bloom and wane,<br/>
> Yet, like love's door, it swings, to and fro."<br/>
> With flower held high, for wanderlust aglow,<br/>
> To drift into tales, where fairy dreams reign.<br/>

> That tome of dreams, once shut, now opens wide,<br/>
> As if our souls, like oars, in sync did glide.<br/>
> Some dreams take flight, some in the heart reside,<br/>
> With whimsy, confusion, side by side.<br/>

> In Autumn's embrace, where dreams and love collide,<br/>
> A sonnet of life, in whispered tones, confide.<br/>
