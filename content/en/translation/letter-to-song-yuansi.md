### *与宋元思书*

* by Wu Jun (Liang Dynasty), 吴均（南梁）
* Translated by ChatGPT, prompted by Mingli Yuan

风烟俱净，天山共色，从流飘荡，任意东西。

The mist and smoke have cleared, the mountains and sky share the same hue. Drifting along the current, we move freely east and west.

自富阳至桐庐，一百许里，奇山异水，天下独绝。

From Fuyang to Tonglu, a distance of about a hundred miles, the landscape is extraordinary, unique in the world.

水皆缥碧，千丈见底，游鱼细石，直视无碍。

The waters are all a clear turquoise, their depths visible to the bottom, with fish and fine stones seen distinctly, unimpeded by the eye.

急湍甚箭，猛浪若奔。

The swift currents are as fast as arrows, and the fierce waves rush forward like galloping horses.

夹岸高山，皆生寒树，负势竞上，互相轩邈；争高直指，千百成峰。

High mountains line both banks, all covered with cold trees, competing to rise with imposing momentum, extending into the distance;

contending for height, they shoot straight up, forming peaks by the hundreds.

泉水激石，泠泠作响。

Springs cascade over rocks, making tinkling sounds.

好鸟相鸣，嘤嘤成韵。

Lovely birds sing in harmony, creating melodious tunes.

蝉则千转不穷，猿则百叫无绝。

The cicadas’ continuous chirping never ends, while the monkeys’ cries are ceaseless.

鸢飞戾天者，望峰息心；经纶世务者，窥谷忘返。

The kites flying high in the sky calm their spirits when gazing at the peaks;

those entangled in worldly affairs, upon glimpsing the valleys, forget to return.

横柯上蔽，在昼犹昏；疏条交映，有时见日。

Horizontal branches provide shade, making it dim even during the day;

sparse branches and leaves cast overlapping shadows, allowing glimpses of sunlight at times.
