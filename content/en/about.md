In 2014, this log stopped updating. I wanted to go back online three years ago, but I never managed to do so because of my busy work. Finally, I focused and set up the website again; it's now back online. Looking at the small articles I wrote more than a decade ago, I find them very amusing. However, I like the first post in all of those records, which says:

> This is a rich and varied world, where people nestle their souls in different places, enacting different stories. Is there a broad, transparent, and bright mind that can embrace all of this?

Everyone needs to have something bright in their heart to support their daily life.

What else can I say about myself? For instance, this little excerpt from "[Conversations on an Alien Planet](/theotherway/different)", I think it's also well-written and very true.

> I often feel that confusion, rather than making me complacent, actually grounds me because the confused me is not the arrogant me; and the clumsy me usually discovers a simple truth after a long search;
> However, the real reward comes next, the joy of solving a small problem... We will feel a kind of pure, small obsession in the heart of the writerâ€”love or curiosity.
> This tiny pure obsession, for a person, will not be worn away by the years but instead bring happiness; for us humans, it's like an inexhaustible stream or a torch that is passed on forever.

In these years, the things I think and write about have matured more than they did over a decade ago, have integrated more into society, and have understood the complexity of the world more. I will strive to present the most beautiful thoughts to everyone.
